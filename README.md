# Portfolio Development Repository

This repository contains the early stages and ongoing development of my personal portfolio. It serves as a place to document progress, refine ideas, and improve the overall design as I continue learning and applying new concepts.

The portfolio is being built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each update in this repository will reflect changes in layout, styling, and functionality as the project evolves.

Feel free to explore the repository and follow the development process as new versions and improvements are added over time.
